# Rocket-landing-like-SpaceX-Falcon-9
How it works:
The rocket knows where the platform is and tilts using the thrust vector towards the platform, taking into account the distance and speed along the X and Z coordinates. When the height is less than 42, the rocket deflects the engine in the other direction to level off. The rocket has settings for engine rotation, thrust force, and engine rotation speed.The platform appears at random coordinates.
